# Common tasks and commands
---------------------------

Some various useful commands are:

   Processor info - /usr/sbin/psrinfo -pv
   Architecture info - /usr/bin/isainfo
   Summary system info - /usr/sbin/prtdiag
   Disk primary partitions - /sbin/fdisk /dev/rdsk/c*d*p0
   Detailed hardware info from BIOS - /usr/sbin/smbios
   Detailed Kernel Statistics - /usr/bin/kstat
   /usr/bin/kstat -h  displays summary usage
   /usr/bin/kstat -l  lists all modules and their statistics

   Solaris VTOC table - /usr/sbin/prtvtoc /dev/dsk/c*d*s2
   Accurate measure of free memory -
       Login as root
       Execute  /usr/bin/mdb -k
       Enter command   ::memstat
       CTRL+D to come out of mdb
   Closer to actual estimate of process memory usage excluding
   the mmap-ed shared libs -
       /usr/bin/pmap -x <pid>
       Look at the total for the 4th column labeled "Anon".
       Also add in any non-Anon memory usage for the process itself.
   See the function call stack of a running process -
       /usr/bin/pstack <pid>

   See which libraries a process is using -
      /usr/bin/pldd <pid>

   See the command line arguments with which the process was
   started -
      /usr/bin/pargs <pid>

   See the process hierarchy -
     /usr/bin/ptree <pid>
     /usr/bin/ptree 1 gives the entire process hierarchy for the system.

   Change Desktop resolution dynamically -
       Execute  /usr/X11/bin/xrandr  to list possible resolutions
       Execute  /usr/X11/bin/xrandr -s <number> to set  the resolution
       In addition Xfce and KDE provide their own stuff for this.

   Look at network stack parameters - /usr/sbin/ndd

   eg: /usr/sbin/ndd /dev/tcp \?  displays all tcp parameters
       Other network devices are /dev/ip, /dev/udp, /dev/icmp, /dev/ip6
       /dev/tcp6, /dev/ipsecah, /dev/ipsecesp, /dev/sctp, /dev/sctp6

   Set network stack parameters - 
       /usr/sbin/ndd -set <network device> <parameter name> <parameter value>
       Only root can do this and be very careful about playing with this.

   Multiple virtual consoles in Command Line login -
       Use the GNU screen utility  /usr/foss/bin/screen utility. After
       executing screen you can use CTRL-AC to create a new console,
       CTRL-AA to alternate between two consoles, CTRL-A<number> to
       switch to a console with a particular number.


# Starting/Quitting GUI desktops on LiveCD
------------------------------------------

While booted from the LiveCD you can execute /usr/bin/stopgui from
a terminal window to fall back to command line mode. While in command
line mode you can execute  /usr/bin/startgui xfce or
/usr/bin/startgui kde  to start one of the desktops.


# Displaying disk partitioning info
-----------------------------------

First execute /usr/sbin/format to identify your disk device. Don't worry
format is not going to immediately format your disk. Upon executing
format you will see output similar to the following:

AVAILABLE DISK SELECTIONS:
       0. c1d0 <DEFAULT cyl 13002 alt 2 hd 64 sec 63>
          /pci@0,0/pci-ide@11,1/ide@0/cmdk@0,0

Note down the name after "0. ", in this case it it "c1d0". Now press
CTRL+D to quit out of format.

Now execute /usr/bin/partmgr /dev/rdsk/<devname>p0. So as per our
example above the command should look like:

/usr/bin/partmgr /dev/rdsk/c1d0p0

This will print an indented human readable dump of the entire partition
table on the harddisk that includes all your extended partitions.

/usr/bin/partmgr /dev/rdsk/c1d0p0 -doslabel

This will print out OpenSolaris device names for all the FAT/FAT32
partitions on the harddisk, whether on primary or extended partition.
If you have booted the LiveCD, these should already be mounted on
/mnt/fat0, /mnt/fat1 and so on.


# Notes on Installing BeleniX to harddisk
-----------------------------------------

Execute the  /usr/bin/hdinstaller  utility from and terminal window in a
GUI desktop to install BeleniX to harddisk. Though the hdinstaller is a
text mode application you can still use the mouse to navigate if you are
running the Xfce or KDE desktop.

* OpenSolaris requires a primary partition. It cannot be installed in an
  extended partition. There is current work going on to fix this.
  For now you need to have a free slot in one of the four primary partitions.

* If there is no Solaris2 partition already present then the installer will
  run the fdisk utility that will display the existing partitions and allow
  you to add or removed partitions. To create a partition in which BeleniX
  can be installed you must select the partition type to be "SOLARIS2" when
  fdisk displays a list in the create partition menu.

* OpenSolaris uses it's own subpartitions within a primary partition. These
  are officially called "slices". You must have a root slice or "/". In
  addition you can have a slice for "/usr", "/opt", swap and so on.
  Hdinstaller allows you to create your own slices or put everything in "/".

  This is different from the way Linux handles it's filesystems. Linux uses
  primary and extended partitions to store the various filesystems including
  swap. OpenSolaris uses it's own definition of slices stored in a Virtual
  Table of Conents (VTOC) within one primary partition. The VTOC defines all
  the individual OpenSolaris filesystems within the OpenSolaris partition.

* At present the hdinstaller will install GRUB as the default bootloader
  (in MBR). If you have other Windows and Linux OSes installed on the same
  system then you will need to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst (after installing
  BeleniX) and add entries to boot the other OSes as well. This will change
  in the next release.

  It will also be made more flexible by providing an option to install GRUB
  in either the MBR or within the Solaris2 partition.

* Starting Xfce/KDE after harddisk installation: At present a GUI display
  manager is not yet configured, so to start Xfce/KDE you will need to login
  from command line and execute "startxfce" or "startkde". This will change
  in the next release.

* If you already have a Solaris2 partition the hdinstaller will just display
  and checkbox with the the partition identified as cNdN. You need to mark
  the checkbox where you wish to install BeleniX and continue.

* Hdinstaller will now ask about manual or auto layout. It is wise to choose
  auto-layout to let hdinstaller calculate space allocation. You do get an
  opportunity to modify the space allocation later. You will also need to
  choose what separate filesystems you want to create. If you are not sure
  here it is wise to just select "/" and "swap" and continue. Everything
  else like "/usr", "/opt" etc will be directories in "/" in that case.

* It takes about 30-40 mins to install BeleniX depending on your CDROM
  speed.

* Hdinstaller also provides an option to install the bundled JDK 1.5. But to
  complete this install you will need a working internet connection. If you
  do not have an internet connection then the JDK will be marked for later
  install. You can execute "/usr/bin/setup_jdk" later after you are booted
  from harddisk and have an internet connection to install the JDK.

  An internet connection is required to download a SunOS C++ runtime patch
  to enable executing Java on BeleniX. This download happens without user
  intervention.


# Setting up a persistent IP Address configuration
--------------------------------------------------

You can use /sbin/ifconfig in the follwing way:

ifconfig <intferface> <ip address> broadcast <bcast address> netmask <net mask>
Or you can execute the /usr/bin/inetmenu GUI tool to configure the interface.

In addition you can use /usr/bin/netprof to have network profiles. You'd need
to create a profile in /etc/netprof/ directory using one of the files as a
template. It is very easy to do. Subsequently you can run /usr/bin/netprof
to select and activate the profile.

But if you want your configuration to persist across reboots without having to
run inetmenu or ifconfig every time you'd need to do the following:

1) Disable inetmenu. This interferes with static configuration:
   svcadm disable network/inetmenu.

2) Select a name for your host and enter it in the /etc/nodename file. This
   file must have exactly one entry, which is the hostname.

Example:

 echo belenix-box-1 > /etc/nodename

3) Edit /etc/hosts and add your hostname to ip address mapping. If you are in
   a domain, you may want to add another entry with the fully qualified domain
   name as well. Example:

 127.0.0.1       localhost
 192.168.0.150   belenix-box-1 belenix-box-1.yourdomain.com loghost

4) Determine which interface will be connected to the network. Lets assume
   that your bge0 network interface is connected to the network. Then create a
   file called /etc/hostname.hme0 which contains the hostname as in step (1):
   Example:

 echo belenix-box-1 > /etc/hostname.hme0

5) Create or edit the /etc/defaultrouter file and enter the IP Address of the
   default router. This will have been provided to your by your network admin
   or ISP. Example:

 echo 192.168.0.1 > /etc/defaultrouter

6) Now you need to setup name resolution. Typically you'll want to use DNS
   and the list of nameservers will have been provided to you by your network
   admin or ISP. So you will have to setup /etc/nsswitch.conf and
   /etc/resolv.conf. Example:

Our example /etc/resolv.conf contains the following lines:

 domain yourdomain.com
 search yourdomain.com
 nameserver 192.168.0.9
 nameserver 192.168.0.11

These details will be different in your case. Execute:

 /usr/bin/cp /etc/nsswitch.conf.dns /etc/nsswitch.conf

Now you can reboot and the settings will automatically take effect. You can
also perform the following tests to confirm that everything is fine:

   1. ping your gateway
   2. ping a machine on your local network
   3. ping your nameservers
   4. ping a well-known host, like www.yahoo.com 

You can also activate the configuration without rebooting. After doing the
above 6 steps execute an ifconfig command as mentioned in the beginning to
directly configure the IP address on the network interface. Then execute
"svcadm enable dns/client" and things should begin to work. Later versions
of BeleniX will contain a Network configurtion UI to avoid having to
manually do all these things.

Example:

   1. Perform steps 1 - 6
   2. Execute:
      /sbin/ifconfig hme0 192.168.0.150 broadcast 192.168.0.255 netmask 255.255.255.0
   3. Add default route:
      /sbin/route add default 192.168.0.1 <- The gateway ip
   4. If you do not have default gateway info:
      /sbin/route add default belenix-box-1 -interface
   5. Execute: svcadm enable dns/client



# Adding and Deleting users
---------------------------

You can add users easily via the graphical KDE User Manager(KUser) utility
or you can do it manually via the command line. If you want to use command
line the text below will be of help:

The /usr/sbin/useradd command can be used to add users.

Example:

 /usr/sbin/useradd -d /export/home/fubar -m -u 1000 -g fugroup -e 10/10/2010 -s /usr/bin/ksh fubar

This example illustrates several options:

-d Sets the user's home directory. On OpenSolaris local users should have
   home directory under /export/home as /home is used by the automounter.

-m Instructs to automatically create user's home directory

-s Sets the user's shell to /usr/bin/ksh. This is optional and shell
   defaults to /bin/sh if this is left out.

-u Optionally sets the user's id. An ID is auto-generated if this is
   left out.

-g Optionally add the user to the given group.

-e Set the expiry date of the user account. Date formats are mentioned in
   /etc/datemsk

The last item is the username.


The /usr/sbin/userdel command can be used to delete users.

Example:

 /usr/sbin/userdel -r fubar

The -r optional switch also deletes the user's home directory.
