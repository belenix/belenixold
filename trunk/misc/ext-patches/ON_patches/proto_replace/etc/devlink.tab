#
# This is the table used by devlinks
#
# Each entry should have 2 fields; but may have 3.  Fields are separated
# by single tab ('\t') characters.
#
# The fields are:
#
# devfs-spec: a keyword-value set of devfs specifications, describing the set
#	of devfs node entries to be linked.
#
#	The keywords are:
#
#	type - The devinfo node type (see <sys/sunddi.h> for possible values)
#
#	name - the devinfo node name (the part of a /devices entry that appears
#		before the '@' or ':').
#
#	addr - the devinfo node address part (the portion of the name between
#		the '@' and the ':').
#
#	minor - the minor-attributes (the portion of a /devices name after the
#		':').
#
#	The keywords are separated from their valuse by an equals ('=') sign;
#	keyword-value pairs are separated from each other by semicolons (';').
#
# dev name - the /dev name corresponding to the devfs node described by
#	the devfs-spec field.  This specification is assume to start rooted at
#	/dev; THE INITIAL /dev/ SHOULD NOT BE SPECIFIED!
#	The name can contain a number of escape-sequences to include parts of
#	the devfs-name in the /dev/-name.  These escape-sequences all start with
#	a backslash ('\') character.  The current sequences are:
#
#	\D - the devfs 'name' field
#
#	\An - the 'n'th component of the address field (n=0 means the whole
#		address field)
#
#	\Mn - the 'n'th component of the minor field (n=0 means the entire
#		minor field).
#
#	\Nn - a sequential counter, starting at n (a *single* digit, giving
#		a starting range of 0 through 9).
#
# extra dev link - a few devices need a second link; that is, a second link
#	pointing to the first link.  This optional field specifies the /dev
#	format of this second link.  This entry can also use the above-described
#	escape-sequences.
#
# Fields can be blank; seperated by single tab characters,
# Spaces are significant, and are considered part of a field. IN GENERAL THIS
# MEANS THERE SHOULD BE NO SPACE CHARACTERS IN THIS FILE!
# All fields must be present (even if blank)
