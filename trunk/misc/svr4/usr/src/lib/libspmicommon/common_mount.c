 * Function:	FsMount
 * Description:	Mount a block special device containing a file system. If
 *		the file system type is unspecified, all possible file
 *		system types are tried until one successfully mounts or
 *		all possibilities are exhausted. If the special device name
 *		specified is a simple slice device name (e.g. c0t3d0s3), the
 *		block special device is assume to exist in /dev/dsk. Otherwise,
 *		the user may supply a fully qualified path name to the block
 *		special device.
 *
 *		NOTE: This function explicitly uses the "mount" command in
 *			order to ensure that the mnttab file is kept up-to-date.
 * Scope:	public
 * Parameters:	device	[RO, *RO]
 *			Device name for which the block device
 *			will be used for the mount. The device may
 *			either be specified in relative (e.g. c0t3d0s4)
 *			or absolute (e.g. /dev/dsk/c0t3d0s4) form.  The caller
 *			of this function is responsible for making sure that
 *			the device name is appropriate for the filesystem
 *			being mounted.
 *		mntpnt	[RO, *RO]
 *			UNIX path name for the mount point directory. This
 *			will be prepended with get_rootdir() by the function
 *			before mounting.
 *		mntopt	[RO, *RO] (optional)
 *			Mount options. If NULL specified, then "mount" command
 *			defaults are used. Options should appear as they would
 *			on the mount line (e.g. "-r").
 *		fstype	[RO, *RO] (optional)
 *			File system type specifier (e.g. "ufs"). If none
 *			is specified, a mount attempt is made for each type
 *			which is defined on the system.
 * Return:	 0	- mount was successful
 *		-1	- mount failed
