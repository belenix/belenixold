 * Function:	mopen
 * Description: Open and memory-map a file (for reading, only).  This is
 *		optimized for the type of files we'll be reading from CD-ROM,
 *		as it uses madvise(MADV_WILLNEED) to get the kernel to read
 *		in the whole file so we don't have to wait for it. MFILE
 *		structures are dynamically allocated and are destroyed
 *		on close.
 * Scope:	public
 * Parameters:	name		[RO, *RO]
 *				Path name of file to be mmapped in.
 *		read_all	[RO]
 *				Whether or not MADV_WILLNEED is to be used
 *				to tell the kernel to read everything.
 * Return:	NULL 	- mmap failure
 *		!NULL	- pointer to MFILE structure for mmaped/opened file
