                     Version 2, June 1991

      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
                            Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General
  Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
  all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of
  the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other
  program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free
  Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library
  General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your
  programs, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
  software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
  receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can
  change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
  and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
  forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
  surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
  software, or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
  whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
  the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too,
  receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them
  these terms so they know their rights.
  
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
  software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
  
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
  certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
  this free software.  If the software is modified by someone
  else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
  they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
  by others will not reflect on the original authors'
  reputations.
  
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
  free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in
  effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we
  have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
  everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.
  
                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
                  DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
  be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
  "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
  derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
  containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
  with modifications and/or translated into another language.
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
  term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
  are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
  output from the Program is covered only if its contents
  constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
  been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
  on what the Program does.
  
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
  Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
  provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
  each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
  warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
  License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
  recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
  Program.
  
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
  exchange for a fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
  conditions:
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
  notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any
  change.
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
  that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
  Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands
  interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running
  for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or
  display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
  notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
  that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
  the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
  view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself
  is interactive but does not normally print such an
  announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to
  print an announcement.)
  
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
  Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
  separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as
  part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
  it.
  
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
  the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution
  of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
  
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
  Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
  the other work under the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on
  it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under
  the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do
  one of the following:
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
  the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
  used for software interchange;
  or,
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
  three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
  your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
  complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
  code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
  above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
  or,
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
  offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This
  alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
  only if you received the program in object code or executable
  form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
  
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
  work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work,
  complete source code means all the source code for all modules
  it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
  plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
  of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source
  code distributed need not include anything that is normally
  distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
  system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.
  
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by
  offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
  equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
  counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
  object code.
  
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
  Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
  Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
  under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their
  licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
  compliance.
  
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
  not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to
  modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.
  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
  License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program
  (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
  acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
  conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
  or works based on it.
  
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
  on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
  from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
  Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not
  impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
  the rights granted herein.
  
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
  parties to this License.
  
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions
  of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
  this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
  other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
  distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the
  Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
  through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
  this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of
  the Program.
  
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or
  unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
  the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is
  intended to apply in other circumstances.
  
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
  infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
  contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole
  purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
  distribution system, which is implemented by public license
  practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the
  wide range of software distributed through that system in
  reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
  the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
  distribute software through any other system and a licensee
  cannot impose that choice.
  
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
  Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
  distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
  distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the
  limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
  new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
  Program specifies a version number of this License which
  applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Program does not specify a version number of this
  License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
  Software Foundation.
  
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
  free programs whose distribution conditions are different,
  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which
  is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
  Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for
  this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
  preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
  software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
  generally.
  
                         NO WARRANTY
  
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
  NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
  COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
  IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE
  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
  WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
  MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
  BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
  INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
  BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
  WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
  greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve
  this is to make it free software which everyone can
  redistribute and change under these terms.
  
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
  should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to
  where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of
  what it does.>
      Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
  
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it
  and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
  version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
  version.
  
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
  useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
  warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
  License along with this program; if not, write to the Free
  Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,
  MA  02111-1307  USA
  
  
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
  paper mail.
  
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice
  like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
  
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
  
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
  type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome 
  toredistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for 
  details.
  
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show
  the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of
  course, the commands you use may be called something other than
  `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu
  items--whatever suits your program.
  
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a
  programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
  disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a sample;
  alter the names:
  
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written
  by James Hacker.
  
    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
  
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
  program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
  subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
  linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is
  what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License
  instead of this License.

    Това е пакет за проверка на правописа за OpenOffice.org. Може
  да свалите OpenOffice.org от http://openoffice.org/.
    Пакетът е продукт на проекта bgOffice. За повече
  информация, прочетете файла README.bgOffice, който идва с
  този пакет или посетете страницата на проекта на адрес:
  http://bgoffice.sourceforge.net.
  
  
                Указания за инсталиране и настройка
  
  
  1. Копирате файловете bg_BG.dic и bg_BG.aff в директорията:
  
    ..\OpenOffice.org\share\dict\ooo
  
    Ако сте инсталирали проверка на правописа на американски
  английски, то в тази директория трябва да се намират файловете
  en_US.aff, en_US.dic и dictionary.lst.
  
  
  2. Отваряте файла dictionary.lst с текстов редактор и добавяте
  следния ред на края му:
  
    DICT bg BG bg_BG
  
  
  3. Стартирате OpenOffice и осъществявате следните настройки:
  - Избирате от менюто Tools/Options;
  - От менюто вляво на изскочилото диалогово прозорче избирате
    Language Settings/Writing Aids;
  - От диалога вдясно избирате
    Available language modules/OpenOffice MySpell SpellChecker;
  - Включвате опцията (ако не е включена);
  - Избирате бутона Edit вдясно от тази опция;
  - Избирате Language - Bulgarian;
  - В полето долу избирате Spelling/OpenOffice MySpell
    SpellChecker и включвате опцията;
  - Избирате бутона Close (за да затворите този диалогов
    прозорец);
  - Натискате бутона OK (за да потвърдите настройките).
  
  
  4. Ако текущият избран език не е български, то трябва да
  изпълните следните стъпки за да го изберете:
  - Избирате от менюто Tools/Options;
  - От менюто вляво на изскочилото диалогово прозорче избирате
    Language Settings/Languages;
  - Сега от същия диалог, но вдясно избирате
    Default languages for documents/Western/Bulgarian;
  - В този момент пред българския език (Bulgarian) трябва да
    виждате знака за проверка на правописа (малка икона с отметка
    на фона на буквите ABC). Това означава, че новите настройки са
    възприети;
  - Натискате бутона OK (за да потвърдите промените).
  
  
  5. В този момент проверката на правописа трябва да функционира.
  Ако имате проблеми, опитайте се да ги разрешите и да ми пишете.

                        ОБЩА ИНФОРМАЦИЯ
  
  
    Този проект има за цел да създаде база с думи за проверка на
  правописа, проверка за съгласуване на частите на речта
  (проверка на граматиката) и сричкопренасяне. Идеята е да се
  направят пакети за поддръжка на българския език за продукти с
  отворен код като OpenOffice.org, aspell, ispell и други.
  
  
    Системата е основана изцяло на книгата/учебника на Кръстев Б.,
  Морфология на българския език в 187 типови таблици. С., НИ,
  1984. Много интересно и полезно четиво. Първоначално идеята
  беше да се създаде проверка на правописа. Имаше събрани
  достатъчно думи, но липсваха правилата за образуване на
  словоформите. След намирането на тази книга, количествените
  натрупвания преминаха в качествени и тогава се промени изцяло
  формата и структурата на данните за да отговарят на тези 187
  типа. Промениха се и идеята, и стратегията за развитие на
  проверката на правописа. Информацията, която сега се съдържа
  във файловете, дава възможност за осъществяване на много повече
  цели освен проверка на правописа. Сравнително лесно може да се
  направи система за проверка на съгласуването на частите на
  речта. Не е трудно да се направи програма за разпознаване на
  думите и определяне на техния тип, лице, числото и дали (не) са
  членувани. Но това са бъдещи планове.
  
  
    Думите идват главно от две места. Първата партида (около 30
  000 думи) идват от "SA Dictionary" (http://sa.dir.bg/) и от "O2
  Dictionary" (известен преди като "Otto Dictionary",
  http://get.to/otto). След това бяха добавени около 20 000 нови
  думи от http://dabuzzard.250free.com/, по-точно от
  http://dabuzzard.250free.com/enbg.zip. Има списък на още около
  30 000 думи в различни форми, които трябва да бъдат проверени и
  класифицирани. От тях може да излязат още около 5 000 - 10 000
  думи в основна форма. Но по-важната задача е да се прегледат
  наличните думи за грешки. Българските имена и фамилии са
  събирани от разни списъци в Интернет. Главно от страниците на
  комисията за изборите, където са публикувани всички кандидат
  депутати и от разни други места, където има списъци с имена на
  хора. Имената на градовете и държавите са събирани от разни
  правителствени страници в Интернет, където има примерно списък
  на страните, с които имаме не знам си каква спогодба.
  
  
    Към системата има няколко скрипта на Perl, с чиято помощ се
  извършва проверка на системата, добавяне на нови думи и
  генерирана на речници за OpenOffice.org, aspell и ispell.
  Най-добре да използвате системата под Linux (понеже голяма част
  от командите, които използвам ги няма под Windows). Ако някой
  иска да ползва системата за генериране на речници или добавяне
  на нови думи под Windows, трябва да си инсталира Perl и Cygwin.
  Но тогава Windows-a ще заприлича на Linux, та затова направо си
  инсталирайте Linux и забравете за Windows.
  
  
    Ако желаете само да добавяте нови думи и да генерирате
  речниците, то прочетете кратките обяснения в стил "Как да?".
  
  
    Ако някой мисли да се занимава с разширяване на системата,
  добре е да прочете спецификацията й. Там има няколко файла,
  които описват структурата на директориите, типовете и файловете
  с данни. Има подробно обяснение на структурата на директориите
  и правилата за дефиниране и създаване на типове и подтипове.
  Описан е и процесът на обхождане на тези типове (файлове) и
  начина на генериране на последователни имена. Има и подробна
  спецификация за вътрешната структура на файловете (формата на
  данните). Описани са правилата за обработка на файл. Описан е
  начинът за образуване на словоформи от основната форма.
  
  
    Всяка помощ е добра дошла. Търсят се доброволци да помагат.

  Diccionari MySpell 0.1
  ----------------------
  
  L'objectiu d'aquest projecte йs crear un corrector ortogrаfic multiplataforma de lliure distribuciу que es pugui fer servir en tots els programes que s'estan traduint al catalа. L'idea es crear un lиxic i unes regles ortogrаfiques i realitzar versions de les mateixes per iSpell, MySpell, AsPell. S'han tingut molt en compte les diferents variants dialectals, especialment el valenciа i el balear.
  
  L'ъnica versiу d'un corrector en catalа d'aquesta mena que coneixem йs l'Ispell d'en Ignasi Labastida que podeu trobar aquн. Durant molt anys ha estat la peзa en catalа de referиncia en aquesta аrea, des de Softcatalа hem decidit comenзar de nou en quelcom mйs sofisticat i elaborat. La feina de l'Ignasi ens ha servit per afinar i constrastar la nostra feina.
  
  Que s'ha fet
  ------------
  
  Bй, s'ha creat un lиxic i les corresponents regles perquи el diccionari pugui declinar les paraules correctament. Actualment el diccionari funciona bй perт hi ha encara problemes que s'han de corregir. Si vols conиixer amb mйs detall el seu estat baixa-te'l.
  
  Coses pedents
  -------------
  
  Provar el corrector per detectar-ne els errors. Els primers que poden inaugurar la llista:
  
  - Falten plurals i femenins (p.e ell/ella/ells/elles). S'haurien de provar  sobretot els pronoms.
  - Hi ha paraules no admeten la preposiciу de (p.e d'on). Crec que sуn  sobretot adverbis i pronoms.
  - Es considera incorrecte "Йs" (en majъscules). .
  - Si s'accepta una proposta amb un apтstrof, OpenOffice no el canvia per un  apтstrof tipogrаfic. Sospit que aixт no es pot arreglar des de MySpell, perт s'hauria d'investigar mйs
  - Els suggeriments no tenen gaire qualitat, ja que no es comenзa pels  errors mйs habituals, ni es proposen paraules a mйs d'una letra de  distаncia. Crec que tenc un pla que pot marxar per arreglar les dues coses alhora.

  NOTAS de ACTIVACION
  ===================
  Hay una problema en la manera de activar la diccionario de Catalan.
  Aqui, una copia del comunicaciуn respecto al problema:
  
   Hola Richard:
   Esta soluciуn que me has dado ha funcionado ya que ahora corrige en
   catalбn. Es una soluciуn temporal, pero lo importante es que se pueda 
   utilizar el diccionario.
   Juan Josй
  
   Richard Holt escribiу:
  
   ...
   >>del todo lo podrнa solucionar. Te agradezco el interйs. Verбs aquн en
  
   >>Barcelona nadie querrб usar el OpenOffice a no ser que sea capaz de 
   >>corregir el catalбn y me interesa como alternativa al Word en el
   >>colegio donde trabajo.
   >>
   >>
   >
   >Hola Juan,
   >
   >Yo se que recibiste la respuesta de Kevin y que ya Tomas, quien esta
   >manteniendo la diccionario, estan buscando una solucion. 
   >
   >Aqui una traduccion en mi espanglish (no se como esta su ingles pero
   >quizбs sera util):
   >
   >Escoje una idioma que no esta usando, asignarlo en dictionary.lst:
   >
   >DICT es CO ca_ES
   >
   >para prestar lo de Colombia pero se ve mбs cerca de Catalan, mбs o
   >menos. 
   >
   >Este quiere decir que ahora, Catalan van a parecer como Espaсol
   >(Colombia), y tienes que fijar la idioma en que trabajas a Colombia,
   >pero segun lo funciona. No es muy elegante pero pronto consigas una
   >verdadero. 
   >
   >"The only workaround is to assign the Catalan dictionary to some
  liitle used  locale and set your language appropriately to actually
  spellcheck  something."
  
  saludos,
  Richard.

  		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  		       Version 2, June 1991
  
   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  			    Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
  rights.
  
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
  distribute and/or modify the software.
  
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
  authors' reputations.
  
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.
  
  		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
  along with the Program.
  
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
      parties under the terms of this License.
  
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
  
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Program.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
  
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
  
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.
  
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
  parties remain in full compliance.
  
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Program or works based on it.
  
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
  Foundation.
  
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
  
  			    NO WARRANTY
  
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
  		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.
  
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
  
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
  when it starts in an interactive mode:
  
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
  
  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
  be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
  
    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
  
  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
  Public License instead of this License.

  The Comprehensive Danish Dictionary (DSDO) is a free spell-checking dictionary
  for Danish published by Skеne Sjжlland Linux User Group (SSLUG).  One thing
  which makes this dictionary different from most other dictionaries is that it
  basically is the result of a vote among the proof-readers.  The editorial
  group has _not_ proof-read all the words in the dictionary, but guides the
  proof-readers and keeps track of the overall status of the dictionary.

  This variation copes correctly with fully capitalized greek words. Penalty
  for this, is the increase of proposed words and bigger vocab size.
  This dictionary is based on greek wordlist and affixes used by ispell 
  (which based on older work of Mitalas and Seraskeris). Many thanks to 
  Voula Sanida (voulariba@source.gr) and Panayotis Vryonis (vrypan@yassou.net) 
  for their help in converting the affix rules and to all the people that
  contributed words to the vocabulary.

  		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  		       Version 2, June 1991
  
   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  			    Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
  rights.
  
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
  distribute and/or modify the software.
  
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
  authors' reputations.
  
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.
  
  		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
  along with the Program.
  
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
      parties under the terms of this License.
  
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
  
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Program.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
  
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
  
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.
  
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
  parties remain in full compliance.
  
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Program or works based on it.
  
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
  
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
  circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
  Foundation.
  
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
  
  			    NO WARRANTY
  
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
  		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
  
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.
  
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
  
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
  when it starts in an interactive mode:
  
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
  
  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
  be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
  
    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
  
  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
  Public License instead of this License.

  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
  version number 2.1.]
  
  Preamble
  
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
  share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are 
  intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to 
  make sure the software is free for all its users.
  
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
  designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software 
  Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but 
  we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the 
  ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
  particular case, based on the explanations below.
  
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, 
  not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get 
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of 
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do 
  these things.
  
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 
  rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
  
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or 
  for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. 
  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object 
  files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library 
  after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show 
  them these terms so they know their rights.
  
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the 
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is 
  no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by 
  someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have 
  is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will 
  not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
  
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any 
  free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively 
  restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license 
  from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license 
  obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full 
  freedom of use specified in this license.
  
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary 
  GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public 
  License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different 
  from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain 
  libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
  
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a 
  shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined 
  work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public 
  License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits 
  its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more 
  lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
  
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does 
  Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public 
  License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an 
  advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the 
  reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. 
  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special 
  circumstances.
  
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage 
  the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a 
  de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed 
  to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the 
  same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little 
  to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the 
  Lesser General Public License.
  
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free 
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free 
  software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free 
  programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, 
  as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
  
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' 
  freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the 
  Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a 
  modified version of the Library.
  
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
  library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code 
  derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the 
  library in order to run.
  
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program 
  which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized 
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General 
  Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as 
  "you".
  
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared 
  so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some 
  of those functions and data) to form executables.
  
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which 
  has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" 
  means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: 
  that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either 
  verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into 
  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
  limitation in the term "modification".)
  
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
  modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the 
  source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
  installation of the library.
  
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
  a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a 
  program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
  Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). 
  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the 
  program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete 
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices 
  that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and 
  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
  
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, 
  thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such 
  modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that 
  you also meet all of these conditions:
  
      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
  
      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices 
         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge 
         to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  
      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a 
  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the 
  facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, 
  then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an 
  application does not supply such function or table, the facility still 
  operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
  
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a 
  purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. 
  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function 
  or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does 
  not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
  
      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and 
  can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, 
  then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you 
  distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same 
  sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the 
  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
  permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
  each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  
      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective 
  works based on the Library.
  
      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library 
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a 
  storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
  scope of this License. 
  
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public 
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do 
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that 
  they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead 
  of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary 
  GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
  instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
  
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that 
  copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent 
  copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the 
  Library into a program that is not a library.
  
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of 
  it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete 
  corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed 
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
  software interchange.
  
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
  designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code 
  from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source 
  code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along 
  with the object code.
  
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, 
  but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with 
  it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, 
  is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the 
  scope of this License.
  
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates 
  an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains 
  portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". 
  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states 
  terms for distribution of such executables.
  
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that 
  is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative 
  work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is 
  true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the 
  Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be 
  true is not precisely defined by law.
  
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure 
  layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten 
  lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, 
  regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables 
  containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall 
  under Section 6.)
  
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute 
  the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables 
  containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are 
  linked directly with the Library itself.
  
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a 
  "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing 
  portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your 
  choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the 
  customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such 
  modifications.
  
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library 
  is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this 
  License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during 
  execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright 
  notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the 
  user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
  
      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
  source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the 
  work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the 
  work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete 
  machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source 
  code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
  modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that 
  the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will 
  not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified 
  definitions.)
  
      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. 
  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library 
  already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library 
  functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a 
  modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the 
  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work 
  was made with.
  
      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three 
  years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, 
  above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
  
      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from 
  a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified 
  materials from the same place.
  
      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials 
  or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" 
  must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the 
  executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be 
  distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
  either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, 
  kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
  
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions 
  of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the 
  operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and 
  the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
  
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
  side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities 
  not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, 
  provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library 
  and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided 
  that you do these two things:
  
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based 
  on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must 
  be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
  
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that 
  part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find 
  the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the 
  Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt 
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
  Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
  this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, 
  from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
  long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed 
  it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute 
  the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law 
  if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or 
  distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate 
  your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions 
  for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
  
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library 
  subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further 
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with 
  this License.
  
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
  excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute 
  so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and 
  any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not 
  permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
  copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could 
  satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
  distribution of the Library.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, 
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such 
  claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of 
  the free software distribution system which is implemented by public 
  license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
   wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on 
  consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to 
  decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
  system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be 
  a consequence of the rest of this License.
  
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in 
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, 
  the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License 
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
  not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation 
  as if written in the body of this License.
  
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
  of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions 
  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail 
  to address new problems or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
  Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version 
  number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
  Foundation.
  
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free 
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, 
  write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is 
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software 
  Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be 
  guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives 
  of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software 
  generally.
  
  NO WARRANTY
  
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
  FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
  PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE 
  LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
  REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
  ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT 
  LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
  SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE 
  WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN 
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest 
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that 
  everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting 
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of 
  the ordinary General Public License).
  
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is 
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  
      <one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.> 
  Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
  
      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
  it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published 
  by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or 
  (at your option) any later version.
  
      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY 
  or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public 
  License for more details.
  
      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public 
  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software 
  Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA 
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if 
  necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

              (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
               
        2.2. Contributor Grant.
        Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
               
              (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
  
              (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of  Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
  
              (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.
  
              (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;  3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
  
  
  3. Distribution Obligations.
  
        3.1. Application of License.
        The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
  
        3.2. Availability of Source Code.
        Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
  
        3.3. Description of Modifications.
        You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
  
        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
              (a) Third Party Claims.
              If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
  
              (b) Contributor APIs.
              If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
               
                  (c)    Representations.
              Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
  
  
        3.5. Required Notices.
        You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
  
        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
        You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
  
        3.7. Larger Works.
        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
  
  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
  
        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
  
  5. Application of this License.
  
        This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
  
  6. Versions of the License.
  
        6.1. New Versions.
        Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
  
        6.2. Effect of New Versions.
        Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
  
        6.3. Derivative Works.
        If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
  
  7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
  
        COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
  
  8. TERMINATION.
  
        8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
  
        8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
  
        (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
  
        (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
  
        8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
  
        8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
  
  9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
  
        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
  10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
  
        The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
  
  11. MISCELLANEOUS.
  
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
  
  12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
  
        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
  
  13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
  
        Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
