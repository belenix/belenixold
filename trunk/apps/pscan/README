Alternate OS scanner utility for BeleniX. This utility scans the partiton
table for other OSes in other partitions in a multiboot configuration. It
then tries to probe for supported OSes and filesystems and auto-generates
GRUB menu.lst entries so that one can easily boot them after installing
BeleniX. BeleniX GRUB goes into the MBR.

This utility uses filesystem support code from GRUB with a couple of GRUB
headers and implements enough of the basic GRUB Api to enable those GRUB
filesystem modules to read data from partitions and allow accessing those
filesystems.

The code attempts to scan through all supported filesystems and "mount"
them in a certain order as is done by GRUB. The filesystem contents are
analysed after a successful mount to determine various characteristics.
For eg. for Windows existence of certain directories like WINDOWS/System
indicates C: drive. For Linux presence of /lib/modules indicates the root
("/") partition. These partitions are bootable so menu.lst boot entries
are generated for these. For Linux, additional processing is needed to
determine the boot entries. Linux's own menu.lst is read to extract those
entries, failing which, a simple chainload entry is generated. In additon
certain Linux files are analysed like /etc/redhat_release to determine the
distribution.
