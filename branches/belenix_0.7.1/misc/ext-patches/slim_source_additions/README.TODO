**** NOTE ****

We need to identify a better method to handling branding in
the installer. At present I have done the ridiculous method
of manually editing all the Installer sources (*.txt, *.c,
*.glade) to replace occurrences of OpenSolaris, OpenSolaris
Developer Preview and OpenSolaris <year>.<month> with the
relevant BeleniX strings.

This *must* change. We should work with the Caiman people
to implement a flexible branding framework in the installer
for other distros to use.
